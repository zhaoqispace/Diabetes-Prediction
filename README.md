# Diabetes-Prediction
Have applied three classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and KNN) to predict whether a female aged above 21 has diabetes based on information such as blood pressure, BMI, age, etc. Data Enginnering and Feature Engineering were performed to evaluate the impact on modelling results.
